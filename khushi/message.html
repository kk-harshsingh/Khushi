const text = `Khushi, I never thought that I would ever be in a relationship again, nor did I have any trust left in love. 

But the day I met you and we started talking, within just 2–3 days I understood you, and that’s when I felt that you are very special. I had already fallen in love with you by then.

Seeing you made me feel that even today, there are girls who truly love and stay loyal. You are so perfect and soft-hearted. I really love you, Khushi, a lot. I want you forever in my life.

I promise to always respect you, support you, stand by you in every situation, and never let you feel alone. No matter what life brings, I want to face it with you. 

You are not just someone I love, you are someone I truly value and cherish. 💖`;
